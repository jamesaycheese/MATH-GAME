#Game 1 
The game provides 1- 9 digits. all digits can be used only once 
You random pick a number from the 1-9 digits list and the 1st number that you pick has to be able to divide by 1 
The second number you pick has to be a number that you have not picked previously. 
For example you picked 2 as your first number then your second number cannot be 2 again. 
The only option you have is 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 
Let's say you pick 4.
so first number is 2 , and second number is 4. 

First number 2 can be divided by 1
First number 2 + second number 4 = 24 can be divided by 2 

lets pick number 3 as 3 
First number 2 + second number 4 +third number= 243 can be divided by 3

so far so good 

The final goal is to use all 9 digits
